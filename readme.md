A lot of people have mappings like `jk` or `jj` to escape insert mode. The
problem with this mappings is that whenever you type a `j`, neovim wait about
100-500ms (depending on your timeoutlen) to see, if you type a `j` or a `k`
because these are mapped. Only after that time the `j` will be inserted. Then
you always get a delay when typing a `j`.

An example where this has a big impact is e.g. telescope. Because the characters
which are mapped aren't really inserted at first the whole filtering isn't
instant.

## ‚ú®Features

- Write mappings in many modes without having a delay when typing
- Customizable timeout
- Map key sequences and lua functions
- Use multiple mappings
- Really small and fast

## üì¶Installation

Use your favourite package manager and call the setup function.

```lua
-- lua with lazy.nvim
{
  "max397574/better-escape.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("better_escape").setup()
  end,
}
```

## ‚ùóRewrite

There was a big rewrite which allows much more flexibility now. You can now
define mappings in most modes and also use functions.

The biggest change was that the `mapping` config option was removed. Check the
default configuration below to see the new structure.

This also deprecated the `clear_empty_lines` setting. You can replicate this
behavior by setting a mapping to a function like this:

```lua
-- `k` would be the end key of a mapping
k = function()
    vim.api.nvim_input("<esc>")
    local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
    if current_line:match("^%s+.$") then
        vim.schedule(function()
            vim.api.nvim_set_current_line("")
        end)
    end
end
```
## Default configuration

To disable all default mappings set the `default_mappings` option to false.   
To disable specific mappings set their key to `false` in the configuration. There's an example in the Customization section.

```lua
-- lua, default settings
require("better_escape").setup {
    timeout = vim.o.timeoutlen, -- after `timeout` passes, you can press the escape key and the plugin will ignore it
    default_mappings = true, -- setting this to false removes all the default mappings
    mappings = {
        -- i for insert
        i = {
            j = {
                -- These can all also be functions
                k = "<Esc>",
                j = "<Esc>",
            },
        },
        c = {
            j = {
                k = "<C-c>",
                j = "<C-c>",
            },
        },
        t = {
            j = {
                k = "<C-\\><C-n>",
            },
        },
        v = {
            j = {
                k = "<Esc>",
            },
        },
        s = {
            j = {
                k = "<Esc>",
            },
        },
    },
}
```
## ‚öôÔ∏èCustomization

Call the setup function with your options as arguments:
```lua
require("better_escape").setup {
    timeout = vim.o.timeoutlen, -- after `timeout` passes, you can press the escape key and the plugin will ignore it
    default_mappings = true, -- setting this to false removes all the default mappings
    mappings = {
        -- mode = {
        --     firstkey = {
        --        endkey = "Escape key", -- make a key press "Escape key"
        --        endkey = false, -- disable a key
        --     },
        -- }
    }
}
```

Here how you can configure Insert-mode:
```lua
mappings = {
    -- i for insert, other modes are the first letter too
    i = {
        -- map kj to exit insert mode
        k = {
            j = "<Esc>",
        },
        -- map jk and jj  to exit insert mode
        j = {
            k = "<Esc>",
            j = "<Esc>",
        },
        -- you can repeat this table pattern forever
        -- map jjk to do nothing
        j = {
            j = {
                k = "",
            },
        },
        -- you can also define mappings with this shorthand
        -- same as the example above, maps jk and jj to escape insert mode
        jk = "", 
        jj = "", 
        -- same as the example above, maps jjk to do nothing
        jjk = "", 
        -- NOTE:  The shorthand doesn't work if you use special characters (<tab>, <c-x> <anything ..>)
        ["jj<Tab>"] = "<Esc>", -- doesn't escape
        -- Though you can use a mix of the shorthand and tables to use special characters:
        jj = {
            ["<Tab>"] = "<Esc>",
        },
        -- NOTE: there's a bug where if a special character is not the final key in a mapping, then the plugin overdeletes characters
        -- This is a limitation as the plugin can't tell if a special key needs to be deleted or not:
        ["<Tab>"] = {
            ["<Tab>"] = "<Esc>",
        },
        
        -- disable jj
        j = {
            j = false,
        },
    }
}
```

You can also use a function instead of keys. So you could for example map
`<space><tab>` to jump with luasnip like this:

```lua
i = {
    [" "] = {
        ["<tab>"] = function()
            -- Defer execution to avoid side-effects
            vim.defer_fn(function()
                -- set undo point
                vim.o.ul = vim.o.ul
                require("luasnip").expand_or_jump()
            end, 1)
        end
    }
}
```

## API

`require("better_escape").waiting` is a boolean indicating that it's waiting for
a mapped sequence to complete.

```lua
function escape_status()
  local ok, m = pcall(require, 'better_escape')
  return ok and m.waiting and '‚ú∫' or ""
end
```

## Similar plugins

The old version of this plugin was a lua version of
[better_escape.vim](https://github.com/jdhao/better-escape.vim), with some
additional features and optimizations. This changed with the rewrite though. Now
it has much more features.
